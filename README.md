Read Meet suffers from some responsiveness issues as some of the navigation bar does not resize responsively. Also upon moving to full screen the positioning suffers on the home page.  Read meet also lacks the ability to view the leader of the club or to search through the clubs in a meaningful way. There is also an issue where clicking on the about navigation link will not do anything on any page but the home page
